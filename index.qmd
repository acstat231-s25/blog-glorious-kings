abstract: "LeBron's legacy is large on the statsheet, but extends much further than just putting the ball in the basket. Through his greatness, he has broken records, cultivated lifelong friendships through teammates, and made those around him into better players. His over 20 year career has changed fundamentally changed the game of basketball, which is displayed through the evolution of his playstyle."

#| out-width: 100%
#| fig-link: "https://www.palmbeachpost.com/story/sports/2017/08/17/how-do-heat-fans-feel/7460287007/"

```

Either approach will take either a filepath to a stored file or a URL to an image or gif. Width can be specified as a percentage of the width of the page (0% to 100%; my preferred approach) or as a fixed number of units (e.g. 400px, 3in, 10cm). 

I can't imagine a scenario where students should or would include videos within their blog, but Quarto provides [guidance on embedding videos](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/videos.html), as well.

## Panel tabsets

Use the following format to add information or tables or visualizations in [tabset panels](https://quarto.org/docs/interactive/layout.html#tabset-panel).

::: {.panel-tabset}

### Tab 1

Some information in one tab 


### Tab 2

Some information in a different tab

:::

## Panel layouts for content


::: {layout="[ [1] ]"}

### Row 1 with only one output

```{r} 
#| echo: FALSE 
#| fig.width: 20
#| fig.height: 16 
#| warning: FALSE

as_tbl_graph(lebron_plot) |>
ggraph(layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.5, color = "lightblue") +
  geom_node_point(size = 12, color = "red") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 8, color = "black") +
  theme_void()

```

The values provided within each row specify the relative widths of the content within that row. For example "[1,2,1]" would create a row with 3 columns where the first and third columns are the same width and the middle column is twice as wide.


## Layouts for tables and visualizations produced by code chunks

For details on how to layout subfigures from multiple graphs produced by the same code chunk, see the examples in the **Knitr** tabs of the sections on [figure layouts, subcaptions, and custom layouts](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/figures.html#layout).

The same syntax shown across the linked examples can be used to create subtables by replacing `fig-cap` and `fig-subcap` with `tbl-cap` and `tbl-subcap`. 

Two examples in @tbl-layout and @fig-layout below are borrowed and slightly modified from the linked sections. 

```{r}
#| label: tbl-layout
#| tbl-cap: "Two tables side-by-side"
#| tbl-subcap: 
#|   - "First three rows of cars dataset"
#|   - "First three rows of pressure dataset"
#| layout-ncol: 2

cars |> 
  slice(1:3) |> 
  kable()

pressure |> 
  slice(1:3) |> 
  kable()
```


```{r}
#| label: fig-layout
#| fig-cap: "Three figures in a complex layout"
#| fig-subcap: 
#|   - "cars"
#|   - "pressure"
#|   - "mtcars"
#| layout: [[4, -1, 4], [1]] 

ggplot(cars, aes(speed, dist)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(pressure, aes(temperature, pressure)) +
  geom_point()

ggplot(mtcars, aes(hp, mpg)) +
  geom_point()
```
