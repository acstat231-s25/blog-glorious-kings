    "text": "What makes a great teammate for LeBron James? Over a career spanning two decades, four championships, and stints with the Cavaliers, Heat, and Lakers, LeBron has played alongside a wide range of players—some who elevated his game, and others who struggled to make an impact. To explore patterns among his many teammates, I used k-means clustering to group players based on their average points and assists per game while playing with LeBron. I also separated players by team to see how their supporting casts differed across each era. This analysis reveals what types of players surrounded LeBron on each team, offering insights into which rosters were superstar-heavy and which required him to carry more of the load, highlighting just how dominant he was, even when the help was limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptions of each clustering group is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperStars: This cluster includes players with high points per game and high assists per game while playing with LeBron. Notably, LeBron played with only one superstar during his time with the Miami Heat. Yet, he won back-to-back NBA Championships, highlighting that this was likely when he was playing some of the best basketball of his career.\nAverage/Above Average Players: These players were essential pieces of the team. They put up consistent numbers each game, and LeBron could rely on these players to have an average performance each night. These players were key for playoff runs, and this group includes scorers and passers who benefited from LeBron being on the floor. Again, we can see that LeBron was not surrounded by many of these players in Miami, highlighting that he played arguably the best basketball of his career to carry this team to back-to-back championships.\nBench Players: This grouping of players had a limited impact on offensive production. Many of these players in this cluster were big men who rebounded the ball or role players known for their excellent defense and hustle. Some members of this group saw minimal playing time and were statistically below average by NBA standards. There impact may not have been seen on the court but they likely contributed to the team in other ways such as leadership, team chemistry, and work ethic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive table below allows you to search through all of LeBron’s teammates and see which players are in what cluster, as well as the team they played with LeBron and their points and assist averages."

    "text": "Over the course of two decades, LeBron James has had one of the most enduring and shape-shifting careers in NBA history. From his debut with the Cleveland Cavaliers in 2003 to his current tenure with the Los Angeles Lakers, LeBron has not only won championships and accumulated accolades — he has continually redefined his role to fit the moment.\nAcross four distinct eras, LeBron adapted to new teammates, coaching systems, and league-wide changes in playing style:\nThis project explores how LeBron’s game has evolved — not just over time, but across geographic and strategic contexts. We analyze his career from four perspectives:\nTogether, these views help explain how LeBron has stayed not just relevant, but dominant, by evolving alongside — and often ahead of — the game itself."

You should use standard bibtex syntax for each entry, following the examples provided. If the resource you are using doesn’t already provide a way to generate a bibtex entry, I recommend using zoterobib to generate the appropriate syntax (must change the Bibliography style to “BibTeX generic citation style”).

Over the course of his career, he’s played in nearly every NBA arena, logging minutes and putting up points across the country. His production by state reflects not only the teams he played for, but also the matchups, rivalries, and playoff runs that defined each era.\nIn his first stint with the Cavaliers, most of his scoring came in the Eastern Conference, especially in cities like New York, Chicago, and Boston — places that often hosted nationally televised games and postseason series. In Miami, his offensive efficiency increased, and he put up consistently strong road numbers, particularly against high-profile teams in both conferences. His return to Cleveland saw a similar pattern, but with an even greater focus on pacing and spacing, which opened up more perimeter opportunities away from home.\nSince joining the Lakers, LeBron’s West Coast presence has expanded. Naturally, he scores the most in California, but he’s also produced heavily in Western Conference cities like Denver, Phoenix, and Dallas — arenas that have hosted some of his biggest performances in recent years.\nThe maps below break down total points by U.S. state for each of LeBron’s four team eras:\n\nCleveland (2004–2010, 2015–2018)\nMiami (2011–2014)\nLos Angeles (2019–2025)\n\nThese visualizations help highlight:\n\nWhere LeBron consistently produced the most points — both home and away\nWhich states show up as high-volume territories due to playoff frequency or conference alignment\nHow geography, travel, and conference play shape long-term scoring patterns\n\n\nFirst Cleveland EraMiami EraSecond Cleveland EraLakers Era\n\n\nSome information in one tab\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome information in a different tab"

    "text": "Shot Selection Over Time\nLeBron’s offensive approach has evolved in clear, measurable ways over the course of his career. Early on, he relied heavily on athleticism — attacking the basket in transition, posting up smaller defenders, and creating mid-range looks off the dribble. In those early Cleveland years, much of the offense was built around his ability to collapse defenses and finish through contact.\nAs he moved into his Miami years, and later returned to Cleveland, his shot selection became more deliberate. He still attacked the paint, but he began incorporating more post play, baseline turnarounds, and selective three-point shooting — especially from the corners. With a more balanced roster around him, LeBron didn’t need to force as many contested drives and was able to read the floor more patiently.\nIn Los Angeles, LeBron’s game has become even more perimeter-oriented. Whether due to age, roster fit, or broader shifts in league strategy, he now shoots threes at a higher volume and uses off-ball movement to find cleaner looks. While he still gets to the rim when needed, he often defers to teammates in the regular season and picks his spots more carefully.\nThe charts below provide a snapshot of this evolution — comparing his rookie season shot locations to those from his most recent campaign.\n\nTrack the shift from interior-heavy scoring to a more balanced perimeter approach\nObserve changes in shot clustering by zone\nReflect on how age, team context, and league-wide trends have reshaped his role\n\n\n\n\nRookie Season (2004)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMost Recent Season (2025)"

    "text": "What makes a great teammate for LeBron James? Over a career spanning two decades, four championships, and stints with the Cavaliers, Heat, and Lakers, LeBron has played alongside a wide range of players—some who elevated his game, and others who struggled to make an impact. To explore patterns among his many teammates, I used k-means clustering to group players based on their average points and assists per game while playing with LeBron. I also separated players by team to see how their supporting casts differed across each era. This analysis reveals what types of players surrounded LeBron on each team, offering insights into which rosters were superstar-heavy and which required him to carry more of the load, highlighting just how dominant he was, even when the help was limited.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptions of each clustering group is provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\nSuperStars: This cluster includes players with high points per game and high assists per game while playing with LeBron. Notably, LeBron played with only one superstar during his time with the Miami Heat. Yet, he won back-to-back NBA Championships, highlighting that this was likely when he was playing some of the best basketball of his career.\nAverage/Above Average Players: These players were essential pieces of the team. They put up consistent numbers each game, and LeBron could rely on these players to have an average performance each night. These players were key for playoff runs, and this group includes scorers and passers who benefited from LeBron being on the floor. Again, we can see that LeBron was not surrounded by many of these players in Miami, highlighting that he played arguably the best basketball of his career to carry this team to back-to-back championships.\nBench Players: This grouping of players had a limited impact on offensive production. Many of these players in this cluster were big men who rebounded the ball or role players known for their excellent defense and hustle. Some members of this group saw minimal playing time and were statistically below average by NBA standards. There impact may not have been seen on the court but they likely contributed to the team in other ways such as leadership, team chemistry, and work ethic\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe interactive table below allows you to search through all of LeBron’s teammates and see which players are in what cluster, as well as the team they played with LeBron and their points and assist averages."
