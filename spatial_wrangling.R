### INITIAL DATA SCRAPING ###

# Define the range of years (all years that LeBron James has played)
start_year <- 2025
end_year <- 2003

### LeBron Game Logs ###

# Define destination folder
dest_folder <- "data/game-logs/"

# Make sure the folder exists
if (!dir.exists(dest_folder)) {
  dir.create(dest_folder, recursive = TRUE)
}

# Function to scrape and save one season

# Loop from 2025 back to 2004

### Team Game Logs ###

# Note, recall that LeBron played for Cavs 2003-2010, Heat 2010-2014, Cavs 2014-2018, Lakers 2018-2025, so we scrape each team like that

# Destination folder

### Unified Logs with Home and Away, and Current Team ###

# Read LeBron's 2025 game log
lebron_2025 <- read_csv("data/game-logs/LeBron_GameLog_2025.csv")

# Read Lakers' 2025 team game log
team_2025 <- read_csv("data/team-game-logs/TeamGameLog_LAL_2025.csv")

# View the column names
colnames(lebron_2025)
colnames(team_2025)

# Make sure dates can match by cleaning up both
# (assuming the 'Date' column is what links them)

# Optional: check column names if needed
# colnames(lebron_2025)
# colnames(team_2025)

### COMBINING EVERYTHING ### (So that we have home AND away represented, as well as the team LeBron played for each season, for spatial data).

# Load packages
