## LeBron and His Teammates

Now that we have established Lebron's legacy through his own statistics as well as the successes of his teammates, let's take a deep dive into his connections with teammates. In addition, we can observe the changes in the game of basketball and the evolution of his career through the years that he played on each respective team.

## The Network


```{r} 
#| echo: FALSE 
#| fig.width: 20
#| fig.height: 16 
#| warning: FALSE

as_tbl_graph(lebron_plot) |>
ggraph(layout = "linear", circular = TRUE) +
  geom_edge_link(aes(width = weight), alpha = 0.5, color = "lightblue") +
  geom_node_point(size = 12, color = "red") +
  geom_node_text(aes(label = name), repel = TRUE, size = 8, color = "black") +
  theme_void() +
  theme(legend.text = element_text(size = 25),
        legend.title = element_text(size = 25),
        legend.key.size = unit(1, 'cm'),
        legend.key.height = unit(1, 'cm'),
        legend.key.width = unit(1, 'cm')
        )

```

The network is weighted based on the total amount of games played with other players. These are 18 players who have played over 100 games with LeBron. As we can see, many of the other nodes (players) have a significant number of edges connected to them as well (indicating high player connections across LeBron's eras). We can see how LeBron cultivated a strong culture in many different areas, especially early in his career. 

Here is a list of teams he has played for and the years he was there, as well as the players in the network who played on these teams. 

- **Cleveland Cavaliers (2003–2010)**  
  - Zydrunas Ilgauskas  
  - James Jones  
  - Anderson Varejao  
  - Sasha Pavlovic  
  - Danny Green  

- **Miami Heat (2010–2014)**  
  - Zydrunas Ilgauskas  
  - James Jones  
  - Dwayne Wade  
  - Mario Chalmers  
  - Chris Bosh  

- **Cleveland Cavaliers (2014–2018)**  
  - Anderson Varejao  
  - Dwayne Wade  
  - Tristan Thompson  
  - Kevin Love  
  - Mo Williams  
  - Kyle Korver  
  - Kyrie Irving  
  - Channing Frye  
  - Iman Shumpert  
  - Richard Jefferson  
  - Matthew Dellavadova  

- **LA Lakers (2018–2025)**  
  - Tristan Thompson  
  - Anthony Davis  
  - Danny Green  

As we can see, there is a large overlap between teams. LeBron sticks with his teammates and builds friendships with them over multiple seasons, resulting in success for both him and others. LeBron’s network reveals significant overlap between teams, especially in his earlier stints with Cleveland and Miami. He often brought familiar faces along with him or reunited with past teammates — players like James Jones, Anderson Varejao, and Dwyane Wade — fostering continuity and trust across different phases of his career. These long-standing relationships weren’t just sentimental; they were strategic. They helped build core units that stayed competitive across seasons, contributing to playoff runs and championship success.

However, a shift becomes clear in his time with the Lakers. Despite spending more seasons in Los Angeles than with any other team, far fewer of his teammates have crossed the 100-game threshold with him. This speaks not only to changes in LeBron’s own approach to team-building — adapting to shorter contracts, shifting rosters, and evolving supporting casts — but also to broader league trends. The NBA today sees more frequent movement of high-profile players, with “star hopping” and the formation of superteams becoming the norm. LeBron, once a pioneer of that model in Miami, is now navigating its aftermath: a league where cohesion is often sacrificed for flexibility, and long-term chemistry is harder to maintain.
